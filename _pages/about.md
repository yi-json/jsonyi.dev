Also known as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), I'm a Software Development Engineer Intern at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the [AWS Compute Optimizer](https://aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/) team, and was previously a Software Engineer Intern at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) in the [Account Opening](https://www.fidelity.com/open-account/overview) team. I'm an undergraduate at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu) double-majoring in Computer Science (B.S) and Statistics (B.S).

I was a Research Assistant at an NSF-funded Research Training Group (RTG) at the UNC Statistics Department under [Prof. Chudi Zhong](https://chudizhong.github.io/) where I optimized Interpretable ML Algorithms in C++ and Python.

Courses I've been an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for:
* COMP 550: Algorithms (Spring 2025)
* COMP 211: System Fundamentals in C (Fall 2024)
* COMP 210: Data Structures and Analysis in Java (Fall 2023, Spring 2024)

My interests lie in low-latency development, operating systems, machine learning, and algorithms.
