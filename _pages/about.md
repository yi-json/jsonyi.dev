Also known as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), I'm an incoming Software Development Engineer Intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) in the AWS Insights and Optimizations team. I was previously a Software Engineer Intern at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) in the Account Opening team using GraphQL and Angular. At school, I'm a junior at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu) double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics and Analytics (B.S.)

I am currently a TA for COMP 550 (Algorithms), and was previously a TA for COMP 211 (System Fundamentals) in C for Fall 2024, and COMP 210 (Data Structures) in Java from Fall 2023 to Spring 2024.

I was also a Research Assistant at an NSF-funded Research Training Group (RTG) at the UNC Statistics Department under [Prof. Chudi Zhong](https://chudizhong.github.io/) where I optimized Interpretable ML Algorithms in C++ and Python.

My interests lie in low-latency development, operating systems, machine learning, and algorithms.
